## üéØ MVP DEFINITION
**Core Value Proposition**: Offline-first AI-powered semantic search with real-time file processing and intelligent content discovery.

**Success Criteria**: Users can search their local documents using natural language and get relevant, contextual results in under 200ms.

---

## üìä CURRENT STATUS AUDIT

### ‚úÖ **WORKING SYSTEMS** (Ready for MVP)
- **AI Search API**: Functional with Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Multi-agent architecture operational
- **Frontend UI**: Advanced search interface with panels and filters
- **File Processing**: Agents ready for PDF, DOCX, text, code files
- **Real-time Search**: API returning structured results in 115ms average
- **Dark Mode**: System preference detection working
- **Deployment**: Netlify configuration ready

### üîÑ **PARTIALLY WORKING** (Needs Integration)
- **File Monitoring**: Chokidar watchers configured but not fully integrated with UI
- **Vector Embeddings**: Embedding generation working, but not connected to real files
- **Agent Communication**: Redis message bus working but not exposed to frontend
- **Privacy Management**: Framework ready but not integrated with search flow

### ‚ùå **MISSING FOR MVP** (Critical Gaps)
- **Real File Indexing**: Search currently uses mock data, not actual test files
- **File Upload Interface**: No way to add new files through UI
- **Search History**: No persistence of user searches
- **Error Recovery**: Limited error handling in search flow

**Solution**: Local storage for search history and user preferences  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Search history stored locally
- [ ] Recent searches suggestions
- [ ] User preferences (theme, view mode) persistence
- [ ] Search bookmarks/favorites

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Risk**: Low - frontend-only feature

### P2.3: **Performance Optimization** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem**: Search could be faster and more responsive  
**Solution**: Implement caching and optimization strategies  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Search result caching
- [ ] Embedding caching for processed files
- [ ] Lazy loading of search results
- [ ] Background indexing of new files

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Risk**: Medium - requires performance profiling

### P2.4: **Better Error Handling & UX** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Problem**: Limited user feedback on errors and processing states  
**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Processing state indicators
- [ ] Clear error messages with recovery actions
- [ ] Offline mode detection and handling
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
